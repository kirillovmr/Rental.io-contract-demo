### Context
We are all aware that the Metaverse is becoming increasingly popular, and that many large corporations are entering the market right now. Similarly to the actual world, there are numerous types of NFTs ranging from art to real estate. The distinction is that in the actual world, you can list and rent your property, but not in the Metaverse.

### Problem
The problem is that you can't actually rent an NFT, so it doesn't work like it does in the real world, where you can rent an apartment in Chicago for a few months and then go to LA and rent one there without having to buy two or more properties. Right now, NFT users have a couple of options. First, you can transfer your ownership to another person or company who will guarantee to refund your NFT. If the tenant does not return an NFT on time, you will only receive collateral and your NFT is lost. And if the company goes bankrupt, all NFTs will be lost. Another alternative is to simply sell it, but what if you don't want to do so but still want to earn some profit from it?

### Solution
Our solution is rental.io which is a unique smart contract that will interact with blockchain technology to enable the leasing of NFTs without any ownership transfer. You may now rent your NFT to anyone in the world with confidence! For a year, a month, a week, a day, or even an hour. NFT ownership is always yours, and no one may ever resell or claim it. Forget about collateral and make profit easily.

### How it works
On our website you will be able to rent or list any NFT that you own. There are three sections displayed right now in the prototype but we will also add more information regarding our $RENT token. The website is currently a prototype but will be developed in the future.

Our contract works on the principle where the owner of the NFT will always be NFT’s owner. The person who will rent it will not be able to resell it, keep it or do anything else with it except for using it. It is the same situation when you rent an apartment in a building. You can live there as long as you have a lease contract but you don’t have the ownership and can’t sell it to other people or even destroy it.

### Business Model and $RENT token
Our first users will be eligible to receive $RENT governance tokens. Our token will be airdropped to our first users which will increase its value in the future if our platform will be used. No fees will be taken for using the Rent and List option - our goal is to support the NFT community.
